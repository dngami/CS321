Steps to run:
1. Open command prompt as administrator.
2. Change directory to the folder containing asm file.
3. run command "c16 -h output.hex -l list.lst file_name.asm".
4. Run xt85.exe.
5. Keep dip switch 1 on always.
6. Switch on 4th dip switch and press reset on board.
7. Press ctrl+d and enter file name test.hex
8. Press enter till download is complete.
9: Once download is completed switch 4th dip to left.

Set frequency of waveform to be generate:
  Store the required frequency (in hexadecimal format) at the memory address 8200. Frequency could be anywhere between 1HZ to 15HZ.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Generating Different waveforms:
  Once the frequency get set, different type of waveforms can be generated by changing the dip switches over the LCI.
  Following configuration of dip switches will form different waves :-
     1. 0x01 = Square waves
     2. 0x02 = Triangular waves
     3. 0x04 = Sawtooth waves
     4. 0x08 = Staircase
     5. 0x10 = Symmetric Staircase
     6. 0x20 = Sine

Application of Waveforms:
  1. Square Waves:
      a. to control the timing of operations in digital systems, such as clock generators for microprocessors.
      b. in analogue circuits from simple lto complex control systems as well as pulse width control systems for audio and radio applications.
    
  2. Triangular Waves:
      a.  useful in many "sweep" circuits and test equipment. For example, switched-mode power supplies and induction motor-control circuits often use a triangular wave oscillator as part of the pulse width modulator (PWM) circuit.
      
  3. Sawtooth Waves:
      a. This waves are known for their use in music.
      b. used in switched-mode power supplies.
  
  4. Staircase/ Symmetric Staircase:
      a. Used in digital to analog conversion.
      b. Used in resolution mapping in various conversions.
  
  5. Sine Waves:
      These are the fundamental waves used for the transformation.
      a.  House appliances
      b.  Industries
      c.  AC motors
      d.  Refrigerators
      e.  Television
